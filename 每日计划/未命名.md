Compared with joining a package tour,I prefer to travel alone when I plan a holiday.My views are as follows;
As we all know,there are so many traveling groups whose travelers are taked to do something they don't want to do. 
For example,most of the people who lead travelers often take their travelers to watch the movies that is not interesting and listen to speaking for taking money. My mother and I were meeting it about 4 years ago.At that time,I dislike traveling to join a package tour.Hence I prefer to travel alone.Secondly,traveling alone is more free.when you travel alone , you don't consider others.You can do everything you want to do.Lastly,everyone has somethings others don't know.Traveling alone is happier than joining a package tour;
So I prefer to travel alone.
